# About Open-Vision-Language

This is a website with an easy-to-remember sub-domain name, to conveniently host scientific projects and results about vision and language.

The current member projects of this domain includes:
1. [SuTI](https://open-vision-language.github.io/suti/): An in-context subject-driven text-to-image generator that draws subject-specific images without fine-tuning. 
2. [OVEN](https://open-vision-language.github.io/oven/): Datasets and Empirical Results for a novel task of ``Open-domain Visual Entity Recognition''.
2. [InfoSeek](https://open-vision-language.github.io/infoseek/): A new VQA dataset that evaluates multimodal LLMs on answering visual infomation-seeking questions.
